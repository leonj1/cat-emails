# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem

Railway deployment was failing during healthcheck with the error:
```
Healthcheck failed!
1/1 replicas never became healthy!
```

The service was timing out after 100 seconds without responding to the `/api/health` endpoint.

## Root Cause

The application was failing to start due to:

1. **Missing required environment variable**: `REQUESTYAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - The LLM service requires an API key to function
   - Previously, the service would fail silently or in an undefined state

2. **Lack of startup diagnostics**:
   - No validation of critical environment variables
   - No detailed logging during startup
   - Errors during initialization weren't being captured
   - Healthcheck couldn't determine why service wasn't responding

## Changes Made

### 1. Critical Environment Variable Validation (`api_service.py`)

Added fail-fast validation at module load time:

```python
def validate_environment():
    """Validate that all required environment variables are set."""
    missing_vars = []

    # Check for at least one LLM API key
    requestyai_key = os.getenv("REQUESTYAI_API_KEY")
    openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    if not requestyai_key and not openai_key:
        missing_vars.append("REQUESTYAI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY")

    if missing_vars:
        # Display clear error message
        logger.error(error_msg)
        print(error_msg, file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)  # Immediately terminate

# Validate on module load
validate_environment()
```

**Benefits:**
- Service **immediately exits** if critical env vars are missing
- Clear, actionable error message displayed
- Prevents running in broken/degraded state
- Railway logs show exact problem

### 2. Enhanced Startup Logging (`api_service.py`)

Added comprehensive startup diagnostics in the `startup_event()` function:

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # Log environment configuration
    logger.info("=== API Service Startup ===")
    logger.info(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    logger.info(f"Working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    logger.info(f"Environment configuration: {...}")

    # Test database connection
    logger.info("Testing database connection...")

    # Initialize with error handling
    try:
        # ... initialization code
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"FATAL: Failed to initialize: {e}")
        logger.exception("Full traceback:")
        # Terminate - cannot function without proper initialization
        sys.exit(1)
```

This provides visibility into:
- Which environment variables are set (without exposing sensitive values)
- Whether database initialization succeeds
- Any errors during startup
- Immediate termination on critical failures

### 3. Resilient Health Check Endpoint

Modified `/api/health` to continue working even if some services fail:

```python
@app.get("/api/health")
async def health_check():
    health_status = {"status": "healthy", ...}

    # Test each component separately
    try:
        # Background processor status
    except Exception as e:
        health_status["background_processor"] = {"error": str(e)}

    try:
        # Database status
    except Exception as e:
        health_status["database"] = f"error: {str(e)}"
        health_status["status"] = "degraded"

    return health_status
```

Benefits:
- Returns detailed status of each subsystem
- Shows version information
- Helps diagnose component-level issues

**Note:** Critical failures (missing API keys) prevent service startup entirely, so the health check only handles non-critical component issues.

### 4. Deployment Documentation

Created comprehensive guides:

**`docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`**
- Required environment variables
- Deployment steps (GitHub & CLI)
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Healthcheck configuration
- Testing procedures
- Performance optimization tips

## How to Fix Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Set Required Environment Variable

In Railway dashboard, add one of these:

```bash
REQUESTYAI_API_KEY=your-requestyai-key
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

### Step 2: Optional but Recommended Variables

```bash
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/summaries.db
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

Railway will automatically redeploy when you push changes or manually trigger:

```bash
railway up
```

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

Watch for startup messages:

```bash
railway logs --follow
```

Look for:
```
=== API Service Startup ===
Environment configuration: {...}
Testing database connection...
Database connection successful
=== API Service Startup Complete ===
```

### Step 5: Test Health Endpoint

Once deployed:

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Cat Emails Summary API",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "background_processor": {...},
  "database": "connected"
}
```

## Testing Changes Locally

Before deploying to Railway, test locally:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export REQUESTYAI_API_KEY=your-key

# Run the service
python3 api_service.py

# In another terminal, test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard
2. **Commit these changes** to trigger redeployment
3. **Monitor logs** during deployment
4. **Test endpoints** after successful deployment

## Files Modified

- `api_service.py`: Enhanced startup logging and resilient health checks
- `docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`: New comprehensive deployment guide

## Expected Outcome

After these changes:

✅ Service provides detailed startup logs
✅ Errors during initialization are visible
✅ Health endpoint responds even if some features fail
✅ Deployment issues are easier to diagnose
✅ Service can run in "degraded mode" if needed
