=== Session 20251129-043217 ===
Workflow: exploration
Task: General project exploration and context setup
Status: Initialized
Context: Explored project structure - AI-powered Gmail email categorizer

Tech Stack:
- Language: Python 3.12
- Framework: FastAPI for API service
- Database: SQLAlchemy with MySQL/SQLite support

=== Session 20251129-045500 ===
Workflow: debugger
Task: Flyway migration validation failure - detected resolved migration not applied to database: 2025112900
Status: Complete
Context: Comprehensive forensic investigation of Flyway configuration using CRASH-RCA protocol

Key Findings from Comprehensive Investigation:

1. Repository Analysis:
   - CLAUDE.md:4-5 claims: "Database schemas get applied from ./sql folder. Dockerfile has entrypoint that applied database schemas using flyway."
   - No ./sql folder exists in repository (verified via find, ls, git log)
   - No .sql files found anywhere in repository
   - No Flyway configuration files (flyway.conf, flyway.toml, etc.)
   - No reference to migration version "2025112900" found in codebase

2. Git History Verification (addressing CodeRabbit review):
   - .gitignore: No sql/ or *.sql exclusions found
   - git log --all --full-history: No commits mentioning sql/ or flyway
   - git log --diff-filter=D: No deleted SQL or Flyway files in history
   - Conclusion: sql/ folder never existed in this repository

3. Docker/Container Configuration Check:
   - Examined all Dockerfiles (Dockerfile, Dockerfile.api, Dockerfile.service, etc.)
   - No Flyway installation or entrypoint scripts found
   - All entrypoints use Python scripts (api_service.py, gmail_fetcher_service.py, etc.)
   - docker-compose.yml: No Flyway service, no migration containers

4. CI/CD Pipeline Inspection:
   - Only workflow: .github/workflows/presubmit-review.yml (CodeRabbit AI review)
   - No deployment pipelines
   - No Flyway-related CI/CD steps

5. Railway Deployment Investigation:
   - railway.json: Uses standard Dockerfile, no Flyway references
   - Error logs show messages ("Deriving Flyway config", "Cleaning up failed migrations") that don't exist anywhere in this repository
   - Conclusion: Flyway execution happens in Railway's infrastructure layer, not from this codebase

6. Actual Migration System:
   - Project uses Python-based migrations in /root/repo/migrations/
   - Migration files: 001-004 (*.py format, not .sql)
   - Uses migrate.py runner with SQLAlchemy

Root Cause Analysis:
- The error "Detected resolved migration not applied to database: 2025112900" means:
  * Flyway FOUND a migration file V2025112900*.sql somewhere
  * But this migration is NOT in the database's flyway_schema_history table
  * Flyway's default validation rejects out-of-order migrations
- The Flyway service and sql/ folder exist in Railway's external infrastructure (possibly a Railway Template, database migration service, or manual Railway project configuration)
- The migration file V2025112900 (dated Nov 29, 2025 = today) was recently created/uploaded to Railway's migration folder
- This repository has NO Flyway configuration - CLAUDE.md documentation is incorrect/aspirational

Resolution Strategies:
1. Query Railway console/dashboard to find the Flyway service configuration
2. Locate the sql/ folder in Railway's filesystem (not in this repo)
3. Either:
   a) Add missing migration to Railway's sql/ folder or remove V2025112900
   b) Enable outOfOrder=true in Railway's Flyway configuration
   c) Run flyway baseline to reset migration history
   d) Migrate from Flyway to the Python migration system already in this repo

Features: 0/1 complete (feature_list.md exists with FEAT-001)

Next: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect actual migration system, or investigate Railway console for Flyway configuration
