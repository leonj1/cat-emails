=== Session 20251129-043217 ===
Workflow: exploration
Task: General project exploration and context setup
Status: Initialized
Context: Explored project structure - AI-powered Gmail email categorizer

Tech Stack:
- Language: Python 3.12
- Framework: FastAPI for API service
- Database: SQLAlchemy with MySQL/SQLite support
- ML/AI: OpenAI API compatible (RequestYAI, Ollama)
- Testing: pytest with BDD (Gherkin feature files)
- Email: IMAP for Gmail, Mailtrap/SMTP for sending
- Build: Docker, Makefile

Key Components:
- api_service.py: FastAPI REST API (100k+ lines)
- gmail_fetcher.py: Main email fetcher and processor
- services/: Business logic layer (60+ service files)
- models/: Pydantic models and SQLAlchemy ORM
- repositories/: Data access layer (MySQL, SQLAlchemy)
- tests/: Unit tests with BDD scenarios

Features: No feature_list.md found - created example at .feature_list.md.example

Next: No next_agent specified - exploration complete

=== Session 20251129-045500 ===
Workflow: debugger
Task: Flyway migration validation failure - detected resolved migration not applied to database: 2025112900
Status: Initialized
Context: Investigated project structure for Flyway configuration

Key Findings During Exploration:
1. CLAUDE.md claims: "Database schemas get applied from ./sql folder. Dockerfile has entrypoint that applies database schemas using flyway."
2. REALITY: No ./sql folder exists, no Flyway configuration found in codebase
3. Project uses Python-based migration system (migrations/ folder with migrate.py)
4. Migration files follow pattern: XXX_name.py (001-004 currently exist)
5. No SQL files (.sql) found in the repository
6. No reference to migration version "2025112900" found in codebase
7. Current branch: terragon/fix-flyway-migration-validation-7w1c6h

Possible Causes to Investigate:
- CLAUDE.md documentation is outdated/inaccurate about Flyway usage
- Flyway is configured in external deployment environment (Railway, etc.)
- Migration version 2025112900 exists in an external location not in this repo
- Production database has Flyway history table with different migrations than code

Features: 0/1 complete (feature_list.md exists with FEAT-001)

Next: Invoking debugger agent for forensic RCA
